We live in a golden age of software engineering. There are many developers out there delivering great value and literally changing the world. You, the average reader, are likely not one of them.

You are much more likely to be working on maintaining a legacy product, developing small, incremental features to a seldom-used application, or even working on infrastructure problems that only really get noticed when something blows up. Just ask a GitHub database engineer.

And yet, I believe it's reasonable to assume you'd like to be happy at work. If you're anything like me, you want not only to pay the bills, but to live with **purpose**. And maybe you do get that some of that purposeful, meaningful living from your relationships or free-time activities. However, there's a chance you might end up spending **10 years of your life at work** - that means it's very difficult to feel content with the direction life is going when your day job does not provide you with the key ingredients for a purposeful experience: things like a sense of **belonging**, **recognition**, or **closure**. Those come easy when the code you're writing is curing cancer, but not so much when you're trying to make some HTML element align properly on a webpage.

The Continuous Delivery methodologies so common at software development shops might contribute to that feeling of despair and purposelessness. I thought I was being clever when I first drafted this, but I'm not the first blogger to compare this to the Greek myth of Sisyphus. Just like Sisyphus was eternally doomed to pushing that large boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down, a developer might feel doomed to continuously deliver ticket after ticket, sprint after sprint, only for a new one to spawn in its place next week.

Agile ceremonies were supposed to help with that, retrospectives in particular. We all get in a room and talk about what went well, and how we can improve - there's your closure, there's your recognition. The truth though is that, even in the healthier workplace cultures out there, a lot more time is spent on what can be improved rather than what went well. In the unhealthier ones, retros are nothing but a blamefest. In most, discussions are likely to revolve around small, pragmatic topics such as workflow, code quality, deployment practices - as they should. But the result is that **the big picture, the stuff that really feeds the soul, remains unaddressed**.

A development team that is committed to the well-being of its developers should look to create opportunities for **celebration** and **gratitude**. We create a celebratory environment when small wins - weekly, monthly or quarterly - are highlighted with gusto and an honest smile, completely isolated from "but this is what we could've done better". In a world stricken by a low self-esteem epidemic, remind your teammates they are appreciated for who they are, not only for the work they produce. 

Gratefulness can be fostered by connecting your team with those they serve. For that, make an effort to surface, early and often, positive feedback and testimonials from leadership, colleagues and customers. Data can help too. Create and expose metrics that celebrate the silent work done by those that go unnoticed, like the number of days without an incident, or the amount of money (or trees!) saved by a cost-reducing effort.

Closure (the act of closing, not the programming language) is also important. Long-running projects that never truly finish will kill any sense of purpose over time. Break projects up into manageable, celebrate-able milestones. Don't also forget to acknowledge and **mourn as team** when projects fail and die, or when colleagues leave. Ritualize and ceremonialize as much as you can in order inject purpose in your day to day.

This stuff may sound simple, but it takes sincerity. There's nothing cringier or more disheartening than insincere, gimmicky efforts to foster team culture. On the other hand, if a real connection is made and people truly believe you care, small gestures go a long way. I'm sure Sisyphus would've been a lot more content if he was greeted with encouraging words from a loving friend - and maybe some cake - every time he reached the top of that hill.
